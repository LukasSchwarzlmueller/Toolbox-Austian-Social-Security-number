# Toolbox-Austian-Social-Security-number

I found myself working with social security numbers on and offline quite a bit and kept making solutions of validating them and changing their format.
To better organize them I combined the solutions into this toolbox.

## Versions
- main.py: combines all 4 tools with a terminal control
- testone.py: checks one Number at a time
- testmulti.py: checks a .txt file, and then splits the data into correct number sets and faulty (.txt should be in 0000000000, ... format)
- texttocsv.py: transforms the input.txt file into a .csv in a format that the "Ã–sterreich Testet APO" page uses (for easy entry into a register)
- one more option within the main.py to combine the testmulti.py and texttocsv.py to only convert correct numbers 

## Packages 
- pandas

## Add
for the csv integration pls write a message happy to share
